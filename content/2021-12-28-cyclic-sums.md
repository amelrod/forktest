Cyclic Sums. What are they? Why should we care? A nice geometric interpretation for them.

# Introduction

We will investigate sums of cyclic groups, their subgroups, and their quotients. We will attempt to gain intuition for these various structures via a geometric interpretation.

First we will explore the general structure of cyclic sums via graphing an integer lattice. We will then intuit the reasoning why

$$ \mathbb{Z}_m \oplus \mathbb{Z}_n \cong \mathbb{Z}_{mn}. $$

when $n$ and $m$ are coprime. Following this, we will explore the general structure of cyclic subgroups and attempt to develop a geometric heuristic for determining the order of an element. That is, we will explain how

$$ \abs{(x,y)} = \lcm(\abs{x},\abs{y}). $$

Then we will examine groups of the form

$$ (\mathbb{Z}_m \oplus \mathbb{Z}_n)/ \langle x,y \rangle $$
