<p>Some rings are closer to being fields than others. A <strong>domain</strong> is a ring where we can do cancellation: if <span class="math">\(ab = ac\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a \ne 0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(b = c\)</span>. Even closer is a <strong>division ring</strong>, a ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. The only distinction between fields and division rings is that the latter may be non-commutative. For this reason, division rings are also called <strong>skew-fields</strong>.</p>
<p>These form a chain of containments, each of which is strict:
fields <span class="math">\(\subset\)</span> division rings <span class="math">\(\subset\)</span> domains <span class="math">\(\subset\)</span> rings</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\ZZ\)</span> is a domain</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\ZZ/6\ZZ\)</span> is not a domain</li>
<li>the set of <span class="math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrices is not a domain; two non-zero matrices can multiply to zero</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\QQ\)</span> is a field (duh)</li>
<li>the quaternions are a division ring</li>
</ul>
<p>Wedderburn&rsquo;s theorem states that this hierarchy collapses for finite rings: every finite domain is a field.</p>
<!-- more -->

<hr>
<p>First, we show that every finite domain is a division ring.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(D\)</span> be a finite domain, and <span class="math">\(x \in D\)</span> be non-zero. The map <span class="math">\(f : D \to D\)</span> given by <span class="math">\(f(d) = xd\)</span> is injective, which we get immediately from the definition of a domain. Because <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is finite, <span class="math">\(f\)</span> injective implies that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is surjective as well. This means there&rsquo;s some <span class="math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(f(y) = xy = 1\)</span>. This makes <span class="math">\(y\)</span> a right-inverse of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>; is it also a left-inverse? Yes! Since <span class="math">\(x = 1x = xyx\)</span>, cancellation gives us <span class="math">\(1 = yx\)</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next step, showing that every finite division ring is a field, is significantly trickier. We&rsquo;ll continue, knowing that <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is a division ring.</p>
<p>Our plan is to re-interpret <span class="math">\(D\)</span> as a vector space, to get some information about its size. Then, we&rsquo;ll drop the additive structure, and apply some group theory to the multiplicative structure. Lastly, our result will be vulnerable to some elementary number theory.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> be the center of <span class="math">\(D\)</span>; the set of elements that commute multiplicatively with everything in <span class="math">\(D\)</span>. The distributive law tells us that <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> is an abelian group under addition, and by definition, <span class="math">\(Z^*\)</span> is an abelian group under multiplication. This makes <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> a field, which allows us to apply some linear algebra to the problem.</p>
<p>As with field extensions, a division ring containing a field is a vector space over that field; specifically, <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is a vector space over <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, where vector addition is addition in <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, and scalar multiplication is multiplication by an element of <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>. This gives us some information about the size of <span class="math">\(D\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> has size <span class="math">\(q\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(D\)</span> has dimension <span class="math">\(n\)</span> over <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(D\)</span> has size <span class="math">\(q^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some linear subspaces of <span class="math">\(D\)</span> (as a vector space). For an element <span class="math">\(x \in D\)</span>, let <span class="math">\(C(x)\)</span> be the set of all elements that commute with <span class="math">\(x\)</span> (this is the <strong>centralizer</strong> of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>). We claim that this is a subspace of <span class="math">\(D\)</span>. It&rsquo;s clearly closed under addition, and we claim it is also closed under scalar multiplication. If <span class="math">\(y \in C(x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z \in Z\)</span>, then it follows quickly that <span class="math">\((zy)x = x(zy)\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math">\(zy \in C(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Because <span class="math">\(C(x)\)</span> is a linear subspace, it has dimension <span class="math">\(q^k\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(1 \le k \le n\)</span>. And if <span class="math">\(x \notin Z\)</span>, we know that both these inequalities are strict. If <span class="math">\(k = n\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(C(x) = D\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in fact in the center. If <span class="math">\(k = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(C(x) = Z\)</span>, and since <span class="math">\(x \in C(x)\)</span> for sure, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is again in <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can apply some group theory. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy_class#Conjugacy_class_equation">class equation</a> is a statement about the conjugacy classes of a group. The details are best saved for another post, but if we have a group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> with center <span class="math">\(Z(G)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(g_1, \ldots, g_r\)</span> are distinct representatives of the non-trivial conjugacy classes, then
</p>
<div class="math">$$ |G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{i=1}^r [G : C(g_i)] $$</div>
<p>Essentially, this comes from the fact that <span class="math">\([G : C(g_i)]\)</span> is the number of conjugates of <span class="math">\(g_i\)</span>, and that the conjugacy classes partition <span class="math">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we apply this to <span class="math">\(D^*\)</span>, and remember our observation about the size of <span class="math">\(C(x)\)</span>, then we get:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ q^n - 1 = (q - 1) + \sum_{i=1}^r \frac{q^n - 1}{q^{k_i} - 1}, \, 1 &lt; k_i &lt; n $$</div>
<p>We claim that this can only happen when <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span>; i.e., when <span class="math">\(Z = D\)</span>. This would prove that <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is a field! From here on out, it&rsquo;s all number theory.</p>
<hr>
<p>First, we claim that each <span class="math">\(k_i\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(n = a k_i + b\)</span> be the result of division with remainder. Since <span class="math">\((q^n - 1)/(q^{k_i} - 1)\)</span> is the index of some <span class="math">\(C(x)\)</span>, it&rsquo;s an integer, so <span class="math">\(q^{k_i} - 1\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(q^n - 1\)</span>, or equivalently, <span class="math">\(q^n \equiv 1 \pmod{q^{k_i} - 1}\)</span>. Substituting <span class="math">\(n = a k_i + b\)</span>, we get that <span class="math">\(q^b \equiv 1 \pmod{q^{k_i} - 1}\)</span>. But since <span class="math">\(b &lt; k_i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(q^b - 1 &lt; q^{k_i} - 1\)</span>, and so we must have that <span class="math">\(q^b - 1 = 0\)</span>; i.e., that <span class="math">\(b = 0\)</span>. (Here, we quietly used the fact that <span class="math">\(q &gt; 1\)</span>.) Therefore, <span class="math">\(k_i\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the next step, we&rsquo;ll need to introduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotomic_polynomial">cyclotomic polynomials</a> <span class="math">\(\Phi_k(x)\)</span>. They have three properties in particular that are of interest to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are monic and have integer coefficients</li>
<li>for any <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, the polynomial <span class="math">\(x^m - 1\)</span> factors as <span class="math">\(\prod_{k \mid m} \Phi_k(x)\)</span></li>
<li>the roots of <span class="math">\(\Phi_k(x)\)</span> are exactly the primitive <span class="math">\(k\)</span>th roots of unity</li>
</ul>
<p>The second fact tells us that <span class="math">\(\Phi_n(x)\)</span> is a factor of <span class="math">\(x^n - 1\)</span>, but also, that it is a factor of <span class="math">\((x^n - 1)/(x^{k_i} - 1)\)</span> &ndash; the denominator cancels out out some of the <span class="math">\(\Phi_k(x)\)</span>, but <span class="math">\(\Phi_n(x)\)</span> is left intact, since <span class="math">\(k_i &lt; n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the quotients <span class="math">\(\frac{x^n - 1}{\Phi_n(x)}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\frac{(x^n - 1)/(x^{k_i} - 1)}{\Phi_n(x)}\)</span> are products of cyclotomic polynomials, each of which is monic with integer coefficients, then they are also monic with integer coefficients. Therefore, if we plug in <span class="math">\(x = q\)</span>, we will get an integer. This means that the integer <span class="math">\(\Phi_n(q)\)</span> divides the integers <span class="math">\(q^n - 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\((q^n - 1)/(q^{k_i} - 1)\)</span>. Note that we had to work for this; it&rsquo;s not an immediate consequence of divisibility as polynomials. For example, consider <span class="math">\(p(x) = x + 3\)</span> snd <span class="math">\(q(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 - x/4 - 3/4\)</span>. While <span class="math">\(p(x)\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(q(x)\)</span> as polynomials, <span class="math">\(p(1) = 4\)</span> does not divide <span class="math">\(q(1) = 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, returning to the class equation, we&rsquo;ve shown that most of the terms are divisible by the integer <span class="math">\(\Phi_n(q)\)</span>, so the only leftover term, <span class="math">\(q - 1\)</span>, is also divisible by <span class="math">\(\Phi_n(q)\)</span>. We claim this is only possible if <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span>, which would then give us our desired result.</p>
<p>Use the third fact about cyclotomic polynomials: <span class="math">\(\Phi_n(q) = \prod (q - \zeta)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> ranges over all primitive <span class="math">\(n\)</span>th roots of unity. Taking the modulus, we get that <span class="math">\(|\Phi_n(q)| = \prod |q - \zeta|\)</span>. From the triangle inequality, <span class="math">\(|q - \zeta| + |\zeta| \ge |q|\)</span>, or, rearranged, <span class="math">\(|q - \zeta| \ge |q| - |\zeta| = q - 1\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(n &gt; 1\)</span>, then this inequality is strict, because equality only happens when <span class="math">\(\zeta = 1\)</span>. Furthermore, since <span class="math">\(q \ge 2\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(|q - \zeta| &gt; q - 1 \ge 1\)</span>. Therefore, if <span class="math">\(n &gt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\Phi_n(q)\)</span> is a product of terms, all of which have absolute value strictly greater than <span class="math">\(q - 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, thus, <span class="math">\(|\Phi_n(q)| &gt; q - 1\)</span>. But this means that <span class="math">\(\Phi_n(q)\)</span> cannot divide <span class="math">\(q - 1\)</span>, and so this is a contradiction!</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span>, which forces <span class="math">\(Z = D\)</span>, and thus <span class="math">\(D\)</span> to be commutative; hence, a field. Q.E.D!</p>
